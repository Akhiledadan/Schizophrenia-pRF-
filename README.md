# pRFModel_schizophrenia
Using Difference of gaussians pRF model to study the neural mechanism underlying visual hallucinations in psychotic disorders

Project to probe the presence of altered neuronal receptive field properties undelying visual hallucinations in people with 
psychotic disorder.

Compared 2 D gaussian pRF model (Dumoulin and Wandell, 2008) and Difference of Gaussians (DoG) (Zuiderbaan et al.,2012) model 
parameters between 11 schizophrenia patients with hallucination, 14 schizophrenia patients with hallucination and 10 healthy controls. 

Used 6 metrics for the comparison - 
                                    2D Gaussian model : full width half max of ,                                     
                                    DoG model         : full width half max,
                                                        Surround size of DoG,
                                                        Suppression index,
                                                        Sigma of positive gaussian,
                                                        Sigma of negative gaussian.
